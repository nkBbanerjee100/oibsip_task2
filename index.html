                    <B>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR</B> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015 was an Indian aerospace
                    scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                    raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
                    four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came
                    to be known as the <b>Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of ballistic missile
                    and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political
                    role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India
                    in 1974.

                    Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    <b>"People's President" </b>, he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public
                    service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat
                    Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours

                        <p class="para1">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Sunni
                            Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the
                            Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was
                            a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father
                            owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
                            uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                            family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
                            properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
                            Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                            business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
                            Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of
                            the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
                            fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
                            poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add
                            to the family's meager income.

                            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking
                            student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially
                            mathematics. After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                            Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then
                            affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He
                            moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
                            While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack
                            of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within
                            the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                            <b>"I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." </b> He
                            narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
                            qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF

                        <br>
                        <p class="para1">After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined
                            the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development
                            Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after
                            becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
                            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at
                            DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
                            scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director
                            of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
                            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first
                            Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
                            near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                            independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and
                            expanded the programme to include more engineers.


                            Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
                            In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard
                            Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s
                            and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and
                            SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

                            Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha
                            as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In
                            the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought
                            to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite
                            the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for
                            these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam
                            played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these
                            classified aerospace projects. His research and educational leadership brought him great
                            laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced
                            missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and
                            scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence
                            Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles
                            instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in
                            getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated
                            Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.
                            Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an
                            intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,
                            although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

                            Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the
                            Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The
                            Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive
                            political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with
                            Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period
                            made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test,
                            K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for
                            issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.

                            In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named
                            the "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care
                            in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</p>

                        <p class="para1">
                            Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                            presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by
                            Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.

                            On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time,
                            expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the
                            Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the
                            Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term
                            in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:

                            I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked
                            for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this
                            juncture.

                            On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by
                            Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.
                            The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state
                            assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's
                            victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.Kalam became the 11th
                            president of the Republic of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati
                            Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have
                            been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the
                            President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier
                            recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India. He was also the
                            first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.

                            During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the <b>People's
                                President</b>, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest
                            decision he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction
                            in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his
                            tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant
                            pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam
                            acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of
                            rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was
                            from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001
                            attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in
                            2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending
                            action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the
                            controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005

                            After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of
                            Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute
                            of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;
                            chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram;
                            professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic
                            and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the
                            International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras
                            Hindu University and Anna University.

                            In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear
                            Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of
                            not speaking with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw
                            him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding
                            the safety features of the plant.

                            In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give
                            Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption

                            On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable
                            Planet
                            Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
                            experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At
                            around
                            6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby
                            Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs
                            of
                            life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden
                            cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were
                            reportedly:
                            "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"

                            Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from
                            Shillong
                            to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force
                            C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the
                            President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal,
                            and
                            the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His
                            body
                            was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi
                            residence
                            at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former
                            prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul
                            Gandhi,
                            and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

                            On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air
                            Base
                            and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that
                            afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and
                            state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon
                            Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V.
                            Shanmuganathan.
                            After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of
                            Mandapam,
                            from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at
                            Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to
                            allow
                            the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.

                            On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground
                            with
                            full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime
                            Minister,
                            the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

                            In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a
                            "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on India's
                            nuclear
                            weapons programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.


                            These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will lead
                            to
                            food, economic and national security.

                            Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked Pramukh Swami, the guru
                            of
                            the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, how India might realise this five-pronged vision of
                            development. Pramukh Swami's answerâ€”to add a sixth area developing faith in God and
                            spirituality
                            to overcome the current climate of crime and corruptionâ€”became the spiritual vision for the
                            next
                            15 years Kalam's life, which he describes in his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual
                            Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji, published just a month before his death.

                            It was reported that there was considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions of
                            books authored by him.

                            Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology,
                            including a research programme for developing biomedical implants. He also supported open
                            source
                            technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large
                            scale
                            would bring the benefits of information technology to more people.

                            Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his
                            resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999. He explained, "I feel comfortable
                            in
                            the company of young people, particularly high school students. Henceforth, I intend to
                            share
                            with them experiences, helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work
                            for a
                            developed India for which the road map is already available." His dream is to let every
                            student
                            to light up the sky with victory using their latent fire in the heart.
                            I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action:
